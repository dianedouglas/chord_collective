***Chord Collective***
====================
By Diane Douglas
---------------------
**A rails app which allows users to create notes and create chords out of these notes.**

*The Notes and Chords are stored in a database so that they could later be used for data visualization (for example: how many people entered minor vs major chords today coming from Oregon?)*

*The user could also use this data to create songs using groups of chords.*

*A Note consists of a name (like 'middle C'), a note (like C or Db), an instrument which should play it, the octave it should be played in, and a loudness value (0-127).*

*This information could later be used to generate sounds and colors when the user picks certain chords.*

**Have fun! ----->>> [Go Play](http://chord-collection.herokuapp.com/).**
